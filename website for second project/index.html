			How do you feel about advertisements hidden amongst your Facebook feed and the fact you are contributing to a big corporation that uses your data to provide content catered to you and only you? This new Google Chrome plug in makes you aware of how Facebook makes money from you and ads by <strong>clicking</strong> on them. On the desktop, advertisements are typically placed on the right side of the screen under a title called Ads, but they also appear on your feed as well. Users have a higher chance of interacting with an ad through their feed resulting in more revenue from Facebook.
